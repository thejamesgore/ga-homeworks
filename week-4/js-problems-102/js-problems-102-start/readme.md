# JavaScript Function Problems

In the starter code you have a file containing a number of tests, and a file with a series of problems to solve:

```bash
starter-code
├── problems.js
└── problems.test.js
```

* Note, there are more files present, these are to set up the test runner, do not alter these files.

To run the tests simply run the command 'npm run test' in your terminal.

Write your solutions in the `problems.js` file. To check your progress, simply re run the tests.

To begin, all the tests have been skipped, to turn on the tests for a problem, navigate to the `problems.test.js` find the name of the function you are currently working on and change the statement `xdescribe` to `describe`. Re run your tests and you should now see that test failing.

When you have finished or move on from a problem, go back to `problems.test.js` file, find the function name and add an `x` to the beginning of the test again. It will now be skipped.

## Tips
- Use the console and `console.log` to help you experiment as you work. You will see this output in your terminal
- Work through the problems one at a time.
- You are not expected to complete all the problems.
- If you've been struggling with a problem for a while, skip it and move on to the next one.
- Feel free to work with a friend or colleague.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Once you are finished, take a look through the `tests.js` file to become more acquainted with what automated tests look like.
