# About You Page

Using flexbox, we can create nice looking, spacious, modern style web pages.

No more floats and tables and other things of the past, just simple CSS.

Build a page about you!

## Step One: Content

List out, in their own sections,

1. your four favourite films
2. your nine favourite albums
3. your ten favourite technologies
4. five cities you'd love to live in

Have section headings and use list elements.

Get movie posters of the films and album covers.
Save them inside an `images/` folder.
Link to them by their _relative_ paths.

## Step Two: Styling

Now we're going to use flexbox to turn our lists into cards.
