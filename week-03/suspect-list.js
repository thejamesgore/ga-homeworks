// Someone's stolen the crown jewels and you're going to solve the case with JavaScript.

// Known facts:
//  the suspect seems to have cut their hand when breaking open the glass case, and type A blood was found
//  the suspect got away through a narrow window, forensics say that their height can be no more than 180cm tall
//  the suspect was able to reach the window apparently unaided so must be at least 155cm in height
//  a size 12 shoe print was left at the scene

// Use filter to narrow down the list of suspects.
