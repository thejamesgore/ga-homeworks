    <h2>About</h2>
    <P>
    Coppa Club is a place for eating, drinking, meeting and unwinding.</P>

    <P>Built around a central, brass bar that’s open on all-sides, Coppa Club has a raised lounge for working and winding down, a 250-cover restaurant with a marble herringbone floor, and a café with booths and a fireplace. Outside, there’s a large, south-facing terrace that catches the sun all day. All our seating is designed to make the most of our view over the river.</P>

    <P>Our menu focuses on thoughtful, unfussy, European food from small plates and snacks to grilled mains, sourdough pizzas and healthy salads. There's a wide selection of breakfast and brunch dishes and the bar serves carefully-chosen wines, beers and classic cocktails as well as new creations.</P>

    <P>We are open from early morning until late at night, seven days a week.</P>

    <P>Drop in for breakfast and stay for dinner. No-one outstays their welcome.</P>

    <p>Coppa Club, 3 Three Quays Walk, Lower Thames Street, London, EC3R 6AH</p>
